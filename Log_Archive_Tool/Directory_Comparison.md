# Directory Analysis
---

## /journal 
    * Primary directory that works closely with systemd's journald's journactl process.
    * the log digit code found in the immediate sub-directory here is actually the machine-id (32-character hexadecimal string)
        * This is generated by systemd
        * This id uniquely identifies the system
        * *To find your machine-id `/etc/machine-id`
        * You would only see additional directories located along side the machine-id if you you were utilizing the journalctl's remote logginf features*
    * The files located within sub-directories here are binary and journalctl can process it.
    * *Its very important to clarify that journactl is powerful and can interact with other log files in other directories as well - not just files here.
    * Because of its binary nature - I view the traditional /var/log/syslog to stil be useful in the case of corruption or a quick human-readable format via editor
